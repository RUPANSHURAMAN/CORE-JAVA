package ExceptionsHandle;
//EXCEPTIONS is not error , error is like when semicolon missing 
//* when a bad user input is given, the pgm will halt abruptly 
//whenever a bad user input is given pgm will halt abdruptly
// hating of pgm abruptly is called EXCEPTION e.g. 

public class A {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int i = 10 / 0; // NO ERROR but exception
		System.out.println();
		System.out.println("COMPLETE");
	}
}
